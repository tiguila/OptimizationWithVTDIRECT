# Variables and equations Setup

Code used here in is from https://github.com/camUrban/PteraSoftware

We customized the code to meet our requirements. The output from `variableSetup.ipynb` script - a.k.a. the parameters for VTDIRECT -, will be used by DIRECT in DELTA to output the optimal kinematics that will maximize the wing propulsion under the two constrains in this optimization problem: thrust and list.



## Structure/Topics herein

1. Installation

2. Plane/surface setup to work with (aka wings)

3. Objective function

4. Define wing movements
